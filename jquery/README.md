this app.

### Using your code editor

If you're using Visual Studio Code, something like
the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
extension could be your cup of tea.

> If you're not using VS Code, it's quite likely that an
> alternative lightweight web server exists for your code
> editor of choice.

### Using the serve package

A lightweight web server, [serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve)
is an alternative that you can run from the command line.

1. Ensure that you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
   installed on your dev machine
1. Navigate to `<project_root>/jquery`
1. Run `npx serve` from the command line
